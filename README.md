Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but i can do it!
Version control allows me to track changes in my code, collaborate seamlessly with others, and revert to previous versions if needed, which makes development more efficient and less stressful.
I find resolving merge conflicts challenging, especially when multiple people edit the same sections of a file, as it requires careful attention to detail to ensure the correct changes are merged.
